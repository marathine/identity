You may wonder: Seems restrictive, __so why bother with a public license at all?__ Why not just make the repository private?

Our thinking is this code may help out anyone who wants to learn, needs a reference on how to accomplish a specific task, or maybe just satisfy the curiosity of looking under the hood :)
